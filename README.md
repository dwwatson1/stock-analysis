# Stock Analysis Using VBA

## An Analysis of Green Energy Stock Data

### Background

Steve's parents want to diversify their investment portfolio by investing in the nascent green energy sector of the market. They've tasked Steve with finding out which green energy stocks had positive or negative returns in 2017 and 2018. Steve has asked for my help in performing a quick analysis, so he can give his parents make a sound investment decision in green energy.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve's parents determine which green energy stocks to invest in. Using ticker, daily pricing (high, low, closing prices), and daily volume from 12 different **green** stocks, I calculated the total daily volume and and annual return for each stock using VBA in Excel. This analysis will not only help Steve's parents determine which stocks invest their money but also allow Steve to use my model for quick, future analysis on large datasets.
